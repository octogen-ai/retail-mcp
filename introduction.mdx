---

**Retail Model Context Protocol (rMCP)** turns a storefront into an agent-accessible API that shopping agents can instantly understand and utilize. It provides retailers a single, standards‑based way to stream live catalog data, pricing, policies, identity hooks, and tokenized checkout to any agentic interface.

- **Unified product schema.** rMCP refines *Schema.org/Product* so fashion, electronics, grocery, and every other vertical speak the same language.  
- **End‑to‑end transactions.** It defines how agents handle account creation, promotions, carts, and secure payment.  
- **Brand‑safe by design.** Retailers stay in control of pricing, inventory, and policy logic—even when the sale happens inside agentic interface.

## Why rMCP?

Shopping traffic is already flowing through LLMs, and it’s increasing by the day. Agentic commerce will continue to grow **with or without** retailer cooperation. rMCP lets merchants **set the standards instead of being scraped**, ensuring brand integrity, first‑party data ownership, and a friction‑free customer experience.

> *For clarity, **retailer** and **brand** are interchangeable here—whether you’re a direct‑to‑consumer label, a multi‑brand marketplace, or a manufacturer with a shopfront, rMCP is your on‑ramp to agent‑driven commerce.*
