**Retail Model Context Protocol (rMCP)** is an extension of the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It standardizes how retailers and brands participate in **Agentic Commerce**.

Specifically, the rMCP extension calls for: 

1. **A unified product schema:** a unified schema allows for plug-and-play agents, analytics without ETL-hell and search-&-discovery parity. We propose a new schema based on [Schema.org](https://schema.org) [Product](https://schema.org/Product). 
2. **Agent and human identities: **We propose multiple schemes for identities, so brands and retailers can 
3. **Search, cart and checkout _tool calls: _**Such that agents can reliably buy on behalf of people. 
4. **Post sales & account tool calls: **support for account and order management.

## What is Agentic Commerce?

Agentic commerce isn’t just shopping in a chat box; it unlocks brand-new possibilities in the customer journey. Think photorealistic virtual try‑ons for any item, swipeable outfit builders, personalized size and fit guidance, or automatic price‑match checks across all retailers, capabilities no traditional web page can orchestrate at scale. Retailers that make their catalog, checkout, and CRM endpoints available to agents will make a successful transition to the era of agentic commerce.

## Why rMCP?

Exposing an rMCP endpoint keeps you in the driver’s seat, feeding agents authoritative catalog data, live pricing, and policy logic to protect brand integrity, deliver a friction‑free customer experience, and ensure agents can safely serve your products.

> ****_For clarity, retailer and brand are interchangeable here—whether you’re a direct‑to‑consumer label, a multi‑brand marketplace, or a manufacturer with a shopfront, rMCP is your on‑ramp to agent‑driven commerce._****
