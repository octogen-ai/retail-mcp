**Retail Model Context Protocol (rMCP)** is an extension of the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It standardizes how retailers and brands participate in **Agentic Commerce**.

- **Unified product schema.** rMCP defines a universal schema based on the [Schema.org](https://schema.org) [Product](https://schema.org/Product) structure, allowing retailers and agents to speak the same language 
- **End‑to‑end transactions.** It also supports how agents handle account creation, promotions, carts, and secure payment on behalf of your customers.
- **Brand‑safe by design.** Retailers stay in control of data quality, enrichment, and policy logic, even when the sale happens inside agentic interface.

## What is Agentic Commerce?


Agentic commerce isn’t just shopping in a chat box; it unlocks brand-new possibilities in the customer journey. Think photorealistic virtual try‑ons for any item, swipeable outfit builders, personalized size and fit guidance, or automatic price‑match checks across all retailers, capabilities no traditional web page can orchestrate at scale. Retailers that make their catalog, checkout, and CRM endpoints available to agents will make a successful transition to the era of agentic commerce.

## Why rMCP?
Exposing an rMCP endpoint keeps you in the driver’s seat, feeding agents authoritative catalog data, live pricing, and policy logic to protect brand integrity, deliver a friction‑free customer experience, and ensure agents can safely serve your products. 

> *For clarity, **retailer** and **brand** are interchangeable here—whether you’re a direct‑to‑consumer label, a multi‑brand marketplace, or a manufacturer with a shopfront, rMCP is your on‑ramp to agent‑driven commerce.*
