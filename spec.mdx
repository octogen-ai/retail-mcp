## A note on Schemas

It is likely agents will maintain a global, cross retailer, product catalog. Agents will query that index for top of the funnel discovery.
This is what Perplexity and ChatGPT currently do: they access a global catalog provided by Google and Bing product search. 

However, as consumers progress through the purchasing funnel, agents will likely need to access the catalog search endpoints provided by the
retailer. This is to ensure reliability of dynamic data such as pricing and availability. 

Thus, we call for a standardized product schema across all of retail. However, non-catalog related tool calls can have varying schemas on a
per retailer basis. The underlying consumer agent LLMs will handle making the apprpriate call and parsing the response.
