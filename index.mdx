title: Introduction
description: "Retail Model Context Protocol"
---
Retail-MCP is an extension of the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). It standardizes how retailers and brand-controlled agents provide commerce-related context to LLMs. 

It establishes a unified universal schema for e-commerce products regardless of the vertical. The schema is based on [Schema.org](https://schema.org) [Product](https://schema.org/Product). It also establishes a protocol for agent identity, checkout, and other interactions between retailers and consumers. 

## Why Retail-MCP?

Retail-MCP helps clarify the interface between retailer MCP servers and consumer MCP clients. 

LLMs and other AI agents are quickly intermediating consumer shopping. This is happening with or without the involvement of retailers. However, their involvement ensures the integrity of the brands they represent and a better user experience.  

For purposes of this document, retailer and brand are used interchangeably. They refer to anyone running an e-commerce store, whether a
brand, fashion label, retailer, supplier, or manufacturer.
